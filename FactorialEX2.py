Question: Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question,
it should be assumed to be a console input.

num = 8

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
    print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    for i in range(1,num + 1):
        factorial = factorial*i
    print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
